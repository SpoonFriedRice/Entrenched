This is a text adventure with audio, so check your audio settings before you start. 

Install instructions for itch.io - Download the .zip file & unzip it. - Run the .exe file. - Running the .exe file might cause a warning "Windows protected your PC". In that case, just  go to More Info >> Open anyway.  

Choose the file text_adventure.exe to play. 

Input "help" anytime to see the list of commands. 

Use up and down ARROWS to scroll the text (not mouse). 

On the input line: 

Blue/red words can be examined, taken and dropped, among other things. Doors can be unlocked and rooms can be entered. (You enter rooms, not doors.) 

Orange words (verbs) can be done. 

Inputting "inventory" will show you what you have taken and are carrying. 

Inputting "look" will show you what is in the room you are in.
